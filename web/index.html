        <h1>Rugburn - Patch for PangYa&trade;</h1>
        <p>
            Rugburn is a patch for PangYa&trade; which does the following:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Disable GameGuard</b>: Rugburn completely disables GameGuard and prevents it from starting up.</li>
                <li><b>Redirect Network Requests</b>: Rugburn can redirect network requests to addresses and URLs, with configurable mappings, making it easier to set up clients for private servers.</li>
                <li><b>Bypass Updater</b>: Rugburn will allow you to run the game file (ProjectG.exe) directly, so you don't need to worry about the updater anymore.</li>
            </ul>
            In short, Rugburn is an all-in-one patch that makes it possible to easily set up stock, original PangYa clients to run with custom servers.
            Rugburn is free, open source software. You may share it as you wish under the license terms.
        </p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Rugburn is a patch for ijl15.dll, an innocuous JPEG decoding library included with PangYa.
            When the PangYa client loads a Rugburn-patched ijl15.dll, Rugburn will patch various Windows API functions to carefully disable GameGuard and redirect network requests.
            In addition, Rugburn will apply a patch to disable the GameGuard health checking routines, so that the game will continue running without GameGuard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Please note:</b> Although Rugburn disables GameGuard, it is <em>not</em> cheating software and cannot be used to facilitate cheating. It fully disables GameGuard and thus can not be used on any official servers.
